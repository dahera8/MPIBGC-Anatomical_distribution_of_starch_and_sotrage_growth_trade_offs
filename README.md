In this repositiry you will find the data and code corresponding to the results shown in the paper named "Anatomical distribution of starch in the stemwood influences carbon dynamics and suggests storage-growth trade-offs in some tropical trees"

The ropository has three folders (data, outpust and scripts). 

In the folder "data" you will find all the data used to obtain the results presented in the paper. There, you can find the starch concentration measurements, the growth rates and the respiration rates measured during 2019 in each of the species evaluated (Dacryodes microcarpa, Sacoglotis guianensis and Ocotea leucoxylon). 

The folder outputs contain all the figures resulting from the different calculation and analysis performed in R

and the folder scripts contain the scripts where all the calculations and analyses were performed. 

If you want to use this data or reproduce the scripts for your research I would be happy to collaborate with you providing extra assistance. Please contact me at the e-mail address: dherrera@bgc-jena.mpg.de
